NICE, a UK authority, evaluates and guides the use of medical treatments,
including drugs and devices, influencing reimbursement decisions. It is responsible
for producing evidence-based guidance and advice on the usage of medicines,
medical devices, etc. Johnson & Johnson aims to enhance their success in securing
reimbursements for their products by examining NICE's historical decisions. An
effective scraping and classification strategy can help Johnson & Johnson make
informed judgments on the approval odds of their medical devices so that they can
better allocate their resources. Our project serves as a proof of concept, offering
valuable end-to-end data engineering and predictive modeling workflow to Johnson & Johnson's Health Economics and Data
Science teams regarding the analysis of NICE's decisions. For medical technology guidance (MTG), our Logistic Regression model showed promsing performance with an accuracy of 77%, our SVM model showed even better performance ith an accuracy of 91%, but this model doesn't give the user an option for manual review. For Interventional Procedural Guidance (IPG), our Neural Network model still needs improvement, as they didn't show a promising result.
